}
\arguments{
\item{y}{outcome variable. A vector.}

\item{x}{independent variable of interest. A vector.}

\item{w}{control variables. A matrix, a vector or a \code{\link{formula}}.}

\item{data}{an optional data frame containing variables used in the model.}

\item{deriv}{derivative order of the regression function for estimation, testing and plotting.
The default is \code{deriv=0}, which corresponds to the function itself.}

\item{bins}{a vector. \code{bins=c(p,s)} set a piecewise polynomial of degree \code{p} with \code{s} smoothness constraints
for data-driven (IMSE-optimal) selection of the partitioning/binning scheme. By default, the function sets
\code{bins=c(0,0)}, which corresponds to piecewise constant (canonical binscatter).}

\item{pselect}{vector of numbers within which the degree of polynomial \code{p} for point estimation is selected.
\emph{Note:} To implement the degree or smoothness selection, in addition to \code{pselect} or \code{sselect},
\code{nbins=#} must be specified.}

\item{sselect}{vector of numbers within which the number of smoothness constraints \code{s} for point estimation is selected.
If not specified, for each value \code{p} supplied in the option \code{pselect}, only the
piecewise polynomial with the maximum smoothness is considered, i.e., \code{s=p}.}

\item{binspos}{position of binning knots.  The default is \code{binspos="qs"}, which corresponds to quantile-spaced
binning (canonical binscatter).  The other option is \code{binspos="es"} for evenly-spaced binning.}

\item{nbins}{number of bins for degree/smoothness selection. If \code{nbins=T} or \code{nbins=NULL} (default) is specified,
the function selects the number of bins instead, given the specified degree and smoothness.
If a vector with more than one number is specified, the command selects the number of bins within this vector.}

\item{binsmethod}{method for data-driven selection of the number of bins. The default is \code{binsmethod="dpi"},
which corresponds to the IMSE-optimal direct plug-in rule.  The other option is: \code{"rot"}
for rule of thumb implementation.}

\item{nbinsrot}{initial number of bins value used to construct the DPI number of bins selector.
If not specified, the data-driven ROT selector is used instead.}

\item{simsgrid}{number of evaluation points of an evenly-spaced grid within each bin used for evaluation of
the supremum (infimum or Lp metric) operation needed to construct confidence bands and hypothesis testing
procedures. The default is \code{simsgrid=20}, which corresponds to 20 evenly-spaced
evaluation points within each bin for approximating the supremum (infimum or Lp metric) operator.}

\item{savegrid}{if true, a data frame produced containing grid.}

\item{vce}{procedure to compute the variance-covariance matrix estimator. Options are
\itemize{
\item \code{"const"} homoskedastic variance estimator.
\item \code{"HC0"} heteroskedasticity-robust plug-in residuals variance estimator
                   without weights.
\item \code{"HC1"} heteroskedasticity-robust plug-in residuals variance estimator
                   with hc1 weights. Default.
\item \code{"HC2"} heteroskedasticity-robust plug-in residuals variance estimator
                   with hc2 weights.
\item \code{"HC3"} heteroskedasticity-robust plug-in residuals variance estimator
                   with hc3 weights.
}}

\item{useeffn}{effective sample size to be used when computing the (IMSE-optimal) number of bins. This option
is useful for extrapolating the optimal number of bins to larger (or smaller) datasets than
the one used to compute it.}

\item{randcut}{upper bound on a uniformly distributed variable used to draw a subsample for bins/degree/smoothness selection.
Observations for which \code{runif()<=#} are used. # must be between 0 and 1.}

\item{cluster}{cluster ID. Used for compute cluster-robust standard errors.}

\item{dfcheck}{adjustments for minimum effective sample size checks, which take into account number of unique
values of \code{x} (i.e., number of mass points), number of clusters, and degrees of freedom of
the different statistical models considered. The default is \code{dfcheck=c(20, 30)}.
See \href{https://nppackages.github.io/references/Cattaneo-Crump-Farrell-Feng_2023_Stata.pdf}{Cattaneo, Crump, Farrell and Feng (2023c)} for more details.}

\item{masspoints}{how mass points in \code{x} are handled. Available options:
\itemize{
\item \code{"on"} all mass point and degrees of freedom checks are implemented. Default.
\item \code{"noadjust"} mass point checks and the corresponding effective sample size adjustments are omitted.
\item \code{"nolocalcheck"} within-bin mass point and degrees of freedom checks are omitted.
\item \code{"off"} "noadjust" and "nolocalcheck" are set simultaneously.
\item \code{"veryfew"} forces the function to proceed as if \code{x} has only a few number of mass points (i.e., distinct values).
                       In other words, forces the function to proceed as if the mass point and degrees of freedom checks were failed.
}}

\item{weights}{an optional vector of weights to be used in the fitting process. Should be \code{NULL} or
a numeric vector. For more details, see \code{\link{lm}}.}

\item{subset}{optional rule specifying a subset of observations to be used.}

\item{norotnorm}{if true, a uniform density rather than normal density used for ROT selection.}

\item{numdist}{number of distinct for selection. Used to speed up computation.}

\item{numclust}{number of clusters for selection. Used to speed up computation.}
