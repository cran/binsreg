\item{dots}{a vector. \code{dots=c(p,s)} sets a piecewise polynomial of degree \code{p} with \code{s} smoothness constraints for
point estimation and plotting as "dots". The default is \code{dots=c(0,0)}, which corresponds to
piecewise constant (canonical binscatter)}

\item{dotsgrid}{number of dots within each bin to be plotted. Given the choice, these dots are point estimates
evaluated over an evenly-spaced grid within each bin. The default is \code{dotsgrid=0}, and only
the point estimates at the mean of \code{x} within each bin are presented.}

\item{dotsgridmean}{If true, the dots corresponding to the point estimates evaluated at the mean of \code{x} within each bin
are presented. By default, they are presented, i.e., \code{dotsgridmean=T}.}

\item{line}{a vector. \code{line=c(p,s)} sets a piecewise polynomial of degree \code{p} with \code{s} smoothness constraints
for plotting as a "line".  By default, the line is not included in the plot unless explicitly

\item{polyreggrid}{number of evaluation points of an evenly-spaced grid within each bin used for evaluation of
the point estimate set by the \code{polyreg=p} option. The default is \code{polyreggrid=20},

interval construction.}

\item{polyregcigrid}{number of evaluation points of an evenly-spaced grid within each bin used for constructing

\item{by}{a vector containing the group indicator for subgroup analysis; both numeric and string variables
are supported. When \code{by} is specified, \code{binsreg} implements estimation and inference by each subgroup
separately, but produces a common binned scatter plot. By default, the binning structure is selected for each

function of interest for testing against the fitting from a parametric model specification.}

binning (canonical binscatter).  The other options are \code{"es"} for evenly-spaced binning, or
a vector for manual specification of the positions of inner knots (which must be within the range of
\code{x}).}

\item{binsmethod}{method for data-driven selection of the number of bins. The default is \code{binsmethod="dpi"},
which corresponds to the IMSE-optimal direct plug-in rule.  The other option is: \code{"rot"}
for rule of thumb implementation.}

\item{nbinsrot}{initial number of bins value used to construct the DPI number of bins selector.
If not specified, the data-driven ROT selector is used instead.}

\item{samebinsby}{if true, a common partitioning/binning structure across all subgroups specified by the option \code{by} is forced.
The knots positions are selected according to the option \code{binspos} and using the full sample. If \code{nbins}

\description{
\code{binsreg} implements binscatter estimation with robust inference proposed and plots, following the
            results in \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09608}{Cattaneo, Crump, Farrell and Feng (2019a)}.
            Binscatter provides a flexible way of describing
            the mean relationship between two variables, after possibly adjusting for other covariates, based on
            partitioning/binning of the independent variable of interest. The main purpose of this function is to
            generate binned scatter plots with curve estimation with robust pointwise confidence intervals and
            uniform confidence band.  If the binning scheme is not set by the user, the companion function
            \code{\link{binsregselect}} is used to implement binscatter in a data-driven (optimal)
            way. Hypothesis testing about the regression function can also be conducted via the companion
            function \code{\link{binsregtest}}.
